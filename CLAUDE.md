```
[File Tree | Main Editor | Secondary Editor]
   30 cols      Equal          Equal
```

### IDE Management
- **Start IDE**: `<leader>is` or `:StartSimpleIDE` (auto-starts on empty Neovim)
- **Window Navigation**: 
  - `<leader>w1` - Jump to file tree
  - `<leader>w2` - Jump to main editor
  - `<leader>w3` - Jump to secondary editor
- **Window Management**:
  - `<leader>w=` - Rebalance windows (keeps file tree at 30 columns)
  - `<leader>wd` - Duplicate current buffer to right window
- **Quick Exit**:
  - `<leader>qq` - Exit all windows and quit Neovim
  - `<leader>qa` - Force quit without saving
  - `<leader>wqa` - Save all and quit

## Development Commands

### Setup and Installation
```bash
# Default setup (config files only - safe default)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Full automated setup (includes all components)
# Note: This now includes Rust/cargo for building avante.nvim
./scripts/setup.sh --full

# Component-specific setup
./scripts/setup.sh pnpm-only      # pnpm only
./scripts/setup.sh starship-only  # Starship only
./scripts/setup.sh config-only    # Config files only (same as default)
./scripts/setup.sh quick          # Quick setup (configs only)

# Manual verification
./scripts/verify-setup.sh

# Flutter project creation
./scripts/create-flutter-project.sh <project-name>

### Safety Script (`~/.claude/scripts/deny-check.sh`)
- Intercepts bash commands before execution
- Checks against deny patterns
- Provides clear feedback when blocking dangerous commands
- Suggests manual execution for blocked operations

### Setup Integration
The `scripts/setup.sh` automatically installs:
- Claude Desktop configuration
- Claude Code safety settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
- Deny check script with proper permissions
- Both configurations are backed up during installation

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

The project includes MCP server configurations for extending Claude Code capabilities:

- `scripts/setup-mcp.sh` - Automated MCP setup script

### MCP Setup
The adaptive MCP configuration is automatically installed with the main setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh  # Includes adaptive MCP setup (config-only mode)
./scripts/setup.sh --full  # Includes adaptive MCP setup with full installation
# or
./scripts/setup-mcp-adaptive.sh  # Adaptive MCP setup only (recommended)
./scripts/setup-mcp.sh  # Legacy MCP setup (fallback)
```

The adaptive MCP setup intelligently detects MCP server installations:
- Environment variable overrides (MCP_*_PATH)
- Executables in PATH
- npm global installations
- Homebrew installations
- Local npm installations
- Falls back to npx for dynamic installation

### pnpm Setup
pnpm is integrated into the main setup workflow:
```bash
# Install pnpm with full setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Install pnpm only
./scripts/setup.sh pnpm-only

# Migrate existing npm/yarn project to pnpm
./scripts/migrate-to-pnpm.sh
```

### GitHub Token Configuration
For GitHub MCP functionality, set your personal access token:
```bash
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN='your-token-here'
```

See `MCP_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration and usage instructions.
